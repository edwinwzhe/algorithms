# algorithms

This repo keeps my code in preparing for coding interviews.
It contains:
* Python implementation of basic algorithms and data structures (algorithms/fundamentals)
* Coding test I had in interviews (algorithms/interviews_coding)
* System design test I had in interviews (algorithms/interviews_system_design)
* My solutions to coding exercises (algorithms/\<category\>.\<exercise_name\>.ipynb)
